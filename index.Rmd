## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the effect private equity ownership of nursing homes has on quality of care. I hypothesize that there might be a correlation between private equity ownership of nursing homes and lower quality of care, for the cost-cutting and restructuring tactics that these firms are associated with seem antithetical to the aims of an ideal nursing home. I find this topic to be particularly timely for two reasons. First, an increasing number of nursing homes are being acquired by private equity firms. Second, Covid-19 hit many nursing homes extremely hard, and as a result, these facilities fell under intense scrutiny.
